      <description>Recently, many researchers employ R to conduct data cleaning, manipulation and visualization. Among all the R packages, ggplot2 is one of the most popular, fancy and powerful tool to visualize data. Although ggplot2 is very convenient and easy to use, it is difficult to plot data in dual y-axis. According to the comments from Hadely Wichham, the main developer of ggplot2, the authors of ggplot2 hold the idea that:
 Itâ€™s not possible in ggplot2 because I believe plots with separate y scales (not y-scales that are transformations of each other) are fundamentally flawed.</description>

      <description>What are storm hysteresis effects? Generally, in order to investigate the dynamics of stream discharge and solute concentrations (C-Q relationship) in a watershed, researchers and environmental engineers usually set up monitoring stations in the watershed outlet. As the temporal dynamics of discharge and solute concentration is an integration of complex hydrological and biochemical processes, the relationship between solute concentration and discharge, hereafter called C-Q relationship, is mostly non-linear. If we plot the concentration against discharge within one storm event in a plot, we are supposed to see a non-linear loop, instead of a linear regression curve.</description>

      <description>Since Jan. 2018, my brand new website is published online. The website is powered by Blogdown and Hugo-academic, and deployed by Github Pages. All the codes are open to public and available at my github repository.
I build this website to achieve two goals: helping others know more about my professional achievements, and presenting my most latest output (with details) to persons of interest. Therefore, I will list my publications, including journal articles, conference presentations and proceedings, and book chapters (if any) here.</description>
