      <description>Since Jan. 2018, my brand new website is published online. The website is powered by Blogdown and Hugo-academic, and deployed by Github Pages. All the codes are open to public and available at my github repository.
I build this website to achieve two goals: helping others know more about my professional achievements, and presenting my most latest output (with details) to persons of interest. Therefore, I will list my publications, including journal articles, conference presentations and proceedings, and book chapters (if any) here.</description>
