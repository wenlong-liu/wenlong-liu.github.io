      <description>Introduction and motivation Nutrients from synthetic fertilizer and manure are the dominating input source in many agricultural watersheds. Such nutrients, when exported into surface water bodies, have been identified as a primary cause of severe eutrophication in surface water bodies, such as Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. To address the effects of agricultural activities on surface water bodies, researchers and environmental engineers are very interested in quantifying the nutrient input from fertilizer.</description>

      <description>What are storm hysteresis effects? Generally, in order to investigate the dynamics of stream discharge and solute concentrations (C-Q relationship) in a watershed, researchers and environmental engineers usually set up monitoring stations in the watershed outlet. As the temporal dynamics of discharge and solute concentration is an integration of complex hydrological and biochemical processes, the relationship between solute concentration and discharge, hereafter called C-Q relationship, is mostly non-linear. If we plot the concentration against discharge within one storm event in a plot, we are supposed to see a non-linear loop, instead of a linear regression curve.</description>
