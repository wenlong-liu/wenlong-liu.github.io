      <description>As of now, Sep.Â 11th, 2018, Hurricane Florence (Category 4) is approaching to eastern coastal areas of United States. There are many ways to track the path of hurricanes (or typhoons) to conduct further analysis, such as flash flooding, ocean surge and property damages. In this blog, the author tries to plot the tracking of hurricanes, using both stastic and animated maps, with the help of R and related packages. Specifically, this blog is a reproducible output.</description>

      <description>Since Jan. 2018, my brand new website is published online. The website is powered by Blogdown and Hugo-academic, and deployed by Github Pages. All the codes are open to public and available at my github repository.
I build this website to achieve two goals: helping others know more about my professional achievements, and presenting my most latest output (with details) to persons of interest. Therefore, I will list my publications, including journal articles, conference presentations and proceedings, and book chapters (if any) here.</description>
