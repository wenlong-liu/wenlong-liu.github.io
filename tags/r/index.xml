      <description>Introduction and motivation Nutrients from synthetic fertilizer and manure are the dominating input source in many agricultural watersheds. Such nutrients, when exported into surface water bodies, have been identified as a primary cause of severe eutrophication in surface water bodies, such as Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. To address the effects of agricultural activities on surface water bodies, researchers and environmental engineers are very interested in quantifying the nutrient input from fertilizer.</description>

      <description>Since Jan. 2018, my brand new website is published online. The website is powered by Blogdown and Hugo-academic, and deployed by Github Pages. All the codes are open to public and available at my github repository.
I build this website to achieve two goals: helping others know more about my professional achievements, and presenting my most latest output (with details) to persons of interest. Therefore, I will list my publications, including journal articles, conference presentations and proceedings, and book chapters (if any) here.</description>
