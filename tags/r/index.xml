      <description>Introduction and motivation Nutrient input to agricultural watersheds is a very popular topic among researchers, engineers and stakeholders. Researchers in United State Geographic Services (USGS) spent a considerable amount of time and efforts to generate fertilizr estimation dataset from synthetic fertilizer and manure. Based on the dataset published by USGS, the author developed an R package, ggfertilizer, to retrieve, summarize and visualize fertilizer data in contiguous U.S.A.
In this post, the author is going to briefly introduce the basics of ggfertilizer and provide a smooth and clear workflow to generate a reproducible fertilizer usage map.</description>

      <description>Since Jan. 2018, my brand new website is published online. The website is powered by Blogdown and Hugo-academic, and deployed by Github Pages. All the codes are open to public and available at my github repository.
I build this website to achieve two goals: helping others know more about my professional achievements, and presenting my most latest output (with details) to persons of interest. Therefore, I will list my publications, including journal articles, conference presentations and proceedings, and book chapters (if any) here.</description>
